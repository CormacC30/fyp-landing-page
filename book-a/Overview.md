# Overview

Welcome to the landing page for Tunepal Nua: ABC Importer

## Description
This project is a contribution to **Tunepal Nua**:
A modern reinvention of the much loved [**Tunepal**](https://tunepal.org/index.html#!/record): Built using the Godot game engine.

A query-by-playing music retrieval system for Irish Traditional Music as well as a wide range of other repertoires.

Tunepal has been around for well over a decade. Created by Dr. Bryan Duggan of Technical University Dublin, "Tunepal Nua" will bring a range of new exciting features to users and lovers of irish music.

Please see post in [Dr. Bryan Duggan's Blog](https://bryanduggan.org/) for announcement on release of "Tunepal Nua".

One such feature: "ABC Importer" is the focus of the work carried out on this project: allowing a local SQLite database to be built on-device allowing offline searching.

## Summary of Contribution as part of this Project
One much sought-after feature in Tunepal has been the ability to search offline.

Musicians frequently find themselves in location with poor or no internet connection, unable to I.D a tune on their app. 

**The ABC Importer** addresses that problem: A program built in Godot (GDSCript) and C++ that imports collections of tunes from ABC files, 
creates search keys, midi sequences and indexes the tune's inforamtion to an SQLite database.
